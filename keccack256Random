// Generate a random number between 1 and 100:
uint randNonce = 0;
uint random = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(now, msg.sender, randNonce))) % 100;
randNonce++;
uint random2 = uint(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(now, msg.sender, randNonce))) % 100;

//What this would do is take the timestamp of now, the msg.sender, and an incrementing nonce (a number that is only ever used once, 
//so we don't run the same hash function with the same input parameters twice).

//It would then "pack" the inputs and use keccak to convert them to a random hash.
//Next, it would convert that hash to a uint, and then use % 100 to take only the last 2 digits. 
//This will give us a totally random number between 0 and 99.
